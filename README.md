# MathConvnets

This repository contains code for the experiments conducted in "Why do CNNs excel at feature extraction? A mathematical explanation."
See: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00919

## Instructions

The repo contains three notebooks:
- Dataset Generation.ipynb
	- Contains code to generate the augmented dataset described in the paper
- FashionMNIST experiments.ipynb
	- Contains code and graphs for dataset size and complexity experiments on the FashionMNIST dataset
- MNIST experiments.ipyb
	- Contains code and graphs for dataset size and complexity experiments on the MNIST dataset

Simply open the notebooks to view figures and graphs used in the paper. The specific figures and graphs to be found are as follows:
